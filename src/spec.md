# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Create a simple chat interface application called CoolGPT4 where users can send messages that persist in conversation history.

**Planned changes:**
- Build backend actor to store and retrieve chat messages with text, timestamp, and sender role
- Create frontend chat interface with message list and input area
- Implement message sending that posts to backend and updates the UI
- Apply modern, sleek design with clean layout and professional color scheme (not blue or purple)

**User-visible outcome:** Users can type messages in a chat interface, submit them, and see their conversation history persist across page refreshes in a modern, professionally designed application.
